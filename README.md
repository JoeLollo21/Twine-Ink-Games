# Games designed by Joe Lollo
A repository of different text adventure games I like to make, either for work *or* when I'm not working.

## Completed games:
''Library Quest'' (2024) - created as a sample/tutorial game for a Twine workshop at the University of Washington Libraries. 

## Ideas:
''Like My Coffee'' (2025, I hope) - the game of silly comparisons.
