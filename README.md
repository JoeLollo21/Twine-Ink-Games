# Games designed by Joe Lollo
A repository of different games I like to make, either for work *or* when I'm not working.

## Completed games:
*Baloney Detectives* (2023) - class project made on Twine, introducing college students to strategies for detecting health misinformation. 
<br>
*Library Quest* (2024) - a text adventure game introducing the University of Washington Libraries' services, created as a sample game for a Twine workshop at UW.

## Ideas:
*Like My Coffee* (2025, I hope) - the game of silly comparisons.
